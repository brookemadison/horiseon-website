## Description 

Horiseon is a marketing agency specializing in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

The client wanted a codebase that follows accesibilty standards and was optimized for search engines. 

I accomplished this by adding meta description tags and keywords this will help reflect the content of the pages resulting in better search engine optimization. I used semantic elements to not only structure the code making it easier to read and maintain but will ensure equal access for people with disabilities.

In this project I used HTML and CSS.

In the future I hope to be able to add media quieries to make this website more accesible to different screen sizes.
